Once upon a time , there was a tortoise and a hare who lived in the forest .
The hare was very proud of his speed and often boasted about it to the other animals .
The tortoise , on the other hand , was slow but steady and never bragged about his abilities .
One day , the hare challenged the tortoise to a race .
The tortoise accepted the challenge , and the race was set for the next day .
On the day of the race , all the animals gathered to watch .
The hare sprinted ahead as soon as the race began , leaving the tortoise far behind .
Confident of his victory , the hare decided to take a nap under a tree halfway through the race .
Meanwhile , the tortoise continued plodding along at his slow but steady pace .
When the hare woke up , he realized that the tortoise was nowhere in sight .
He quickly started running again , but it was too late .
By the time he reached the finish line , the tortoise had already crossed it and won the race .
The moral of the story is that slow and steady wins the race .
